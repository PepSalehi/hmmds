I (Andy Fraser) started this project on 2012-10-31.  I will rewrite
the code for my book "Hidden Markov Models and Dynamical Systems"
using the following tools: python3, numpy, scipy, sphinx, doctest, qt4

and not using: gnuplot, swig, c

I will sacrifice the appearance of plots to simplicity of the code.  I
hope that the scipy sparse matrix package will let me have simple fast
code.  I will choose simplicity over speed within reason.

My starting point is the project "webhmmds" in svn at
http://fraserphysics.com/webhmmds.  After I get the hmm code with most
output model options running and documented/tested with
sphinx/doctest, I will put the project on google_code under git and
GPL3.  I will use a single brief LaTeX document instead of the text
that SIAM owns to collect the figures.

To do:

1. Write code to analyze apnea data to make sure that you have basic
    hmm class with enough flexibility to handle: Multiple sets of
    training data; Custom output models; Decoding class sequences.

    code/plotscripts/LDA.py
    code/plotscripts/class1.py
    code/hmm/PFsurvey.py

2. Write variant module that uses Gaussian output model.  Goals: test
   ability to generalize base class.  Illustrate generalization.

3. Move to google repository

99. Move code/plotscripts/StatePic.py to code/applications/synthetic

100. Get 2 axes rather than box for matplotlib plots
