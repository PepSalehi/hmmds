I (Andy Fraser) started this project on 2012-10-31.  I will rewrite
the code for my book "Hidden Markov Models and Dynamical Systems"
using the following tools: python3, numpy, scipy, sphinx, doctest, qt4

and not using: gnuplot, swig, c

I will sacrifice the appearance of plots to simplicity of the code.  I
hope that the scipy sparse matrix package will let me have simple fast
code.  I will choose simplicity over speed within reason.

My starting point is the project "webhmmds" in svn at
http://fraserphysics.com/webhmmds.  After I get the hmm code with most
output model options running and documented/tested with
sphinx/doctest, I will put the project on google_code under git and
GPL3.  I will use a single brief LaTeX document instead of the text
that SIAM owns to collect the figures.

To do:

1. Write code to make cover plot using data copied from old project.

   From webhmmds/Makefile:

STATES    = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
STATEDATA = ${D}/states  $(foreach state, ${STATES},
${D}/state${state})
${D}/m12s.4y : ${P}/MakeModel.py ${D}/lorenz.4
        ${PYTHON} ${P}/MakeModel.py ${D} lorenz.4 m12s.4y
$(call atomic, ${STATEDATA}, ${D}/m12s.4y ${D}/lorenz.4
${P}/StatePic.py)
        ${PYTHON} ${P}/StatePic.py ${D} lorenz.4 lorenz.xyz m12s.4y


${F}/Statesintro.pdf: ${PS}/stateplot.py ${STATEDATA}
        python  ${PS}/stateplot.py ${D} state $@

  A. Start with numpy arrays/matrices and do enough to make the plot

  B. Do git init early.  Use sphinx and doctest.

  C. Figure out how to use scipy sparse matrices as option

  D. Make the directory the importable thing with __init__.py

2. Write code to make the data for the cover plot.  Probably cython.

3. Write code to analyze apnea data to make sure that you have basic
    hmm class with enough flexibility to handle: Multiple sets of
    training data; Custom output models; Decoding class sequences.
