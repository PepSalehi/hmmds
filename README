I (Andy Fraser) started this project on 2012-10-31.  I will rewrite
the code for my book "Hidden Markov Models and Dynamical Systems"
using the following tools: python3, numpy, scipy, sphinx, doctest, qt4

and not using: gnuplot, swig, c

I will sacrifice the appearance of plots to simplicity of the code.  I
hope that the scipy sparse matrix package will let me have simple fast
code.  I will choose simplicity over speed within reason.

My starting point is the project "webhmmds" in svn at
http://fraserphysics.com/webhmmds.  After I get the hmm code with most
output model options running and documented/tested with
sphinx/doctest, I will put the project on google_code under git and
GPL3.  I will use a single brief LaTeX document instead of the text
that SIAM owns to collect the figures.

To do:

1.  Figure out how to use scipy sparse matrices in hmm
    
    Scalar.py: Easiest to read

    C.pyx      Cython subclasses of Scalar

        A. Write fast SPARSE.step_forward() and SPARSE.step_back()
        B. Write fast HMM_SPARSE.forward() and HMM_SPARSE.backward()
        C. Implement all methods of SPARSE using only sparse representation

2. Rewrite python code in plotscripts/

3. Ask Guy to look at style.

4. Write code to analyze apnea data to make sure that you have basic
    hmm class with enough flexibility to handle: Multiple sets of
    training data; Custom output models; Decoding class sequences.
